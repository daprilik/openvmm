Note: We recommend using [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/) to run unit / VMM
tests. It is a significant improvement over the built-in `cargo test` runner,
and is the test runner we use in all our CI pipelines.

You can install it locally by running: `cargo install cargo-nextest --locked`

See the [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/) documentation for more info.
